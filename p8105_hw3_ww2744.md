  relatively few. The second most commonly observed value is `NA`,
  indicating there are still lots of missing data.

The hex plot shows that most data points are tightly clustered in the
center, with some variability. However, occasional instances where tmax
is less than tmin raise concerns about data quality. The ridge plot
reveals a multimodal distribution of snowfall within a year, with most
stations receiving 0-35 mm of snow.

- For `less than high school education` and `More than high school`
  group, the age distributions of men and women are relatively similar,
  though women show slightly more concentration around the median.

- For `High shcool equivalent`, the upper and lower bounds of the
  boxplot for the female group are shifted upward compared to the male
  group, indicating that the overall age distribution for women in this
  education level is higher. This suggests that female participants in
  this category tend to be older on average or that women in this
  educational stage may have pursued education at a later age.

- Across all education levels, both men and women show a decline in
  total activity with increasing age. This decline is especially
  pronounced after the age of 60.

- Female participants maintain more stable activity levels over the
  lifespan, with less dramatic declines than men

- Participants with higher education show more stable activity levels
  over time, suggesting that education may correlate with better health
  awareness and sustained physical activity.

- Across all three education levels, the daily activity follows a clear
  diurnal pattern. Activity starts to increase early in the day, peaks
  around midday or early afternoon, and declines toward the evening and
  night hours.

- Female participants exhibit slightly higher levels of activity
  throughout the day compared to males, particularly during the peak
  hours of activity.

- In the `More than high school` group, compared to the other two
  groups, the difference between males and females becomes more
  pronounced. Males show a larger gap in activity levels compared to
  females from midday to evening.

- The overall trend shows continuous growth, indicating that more and
  more people are choosing Citi Bike as a means of transportation.
  Between January and July of 2020 and 2024, casual riders experienced
  an increase of approximately fivefold. However, due to the larger
  baseline in 2024, the actual number of additional riders is higher in
  2024.

- For members, there was a significant increase in 2024 compared to
  2020, with the total number of members increasing by 16,000, almost
  double the number from July 2020. However, the absolute increase in
  the number of rides between July 2020 and January 2024 was relatively
  small.

- In `January`, Ride durations are generally shorter and more stable
  throughout the week, staying below 10 minutes for most days.

- In `July`, Ride durations are notably longer, with a clear increase
  during the weekends. This suggests that ride behavior changes
  significantly between winter and summer months, possibly due to
  weather conditions or seasonal activities. `July` shows more
  variability and longer ride durations, likely due to better weather
  and more outdoor activities.

- Ride durations have generally decreased over the years. This might
  reflect changes in user behavior, infrastructure improvements, or new
  transportation policies over time.

- `Casual riders` consistently exhibit longer ride durations compared to
  `Members` across all bike types. This pattern is expected as casual
  riders may use the bikes more for leisure or tourism, while members
  are more likely to use them for commuting or short trips.

- `Electric bikes` have generally shorter ride durations compared to
  classic bikes for both user types. This reflects the convenience and
  faster speeds of electric bikes, which allow users to complete trips
  more quickly.

- The plot reflects the increased availability and popularity of
  electric bikes in 2024, with both members and casual riders making
  significant use of them.

- Across all bike types, some extreme outliers are observed,
  particularly among casual riders. These might represent special
  events, tourist usage, or issues with bike returns, which result in
  abnormally long trips.
