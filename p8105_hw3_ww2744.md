- The most commonly observed values for snow is `0`, as it is common
  knowledge that the number of days with snowfall in a year is
  relatively few. The second most commonly observed value is `NA`,
  indicating there are still lots of missing data.

The hex plot shows that most data points are tightly clustered in the
center, with some variability. However, occasional instances where tmax
is less than tmin raise concerns about data quality. The ridge plot
reveals a multimodal distribution of snowfall within a year, with most
stations receiving 0-35 mm of snow.

- For `less than high school education` and `More than high school`
  group, the age distributions of men and women are relatively similar,
  though women show slightly more concentration around the median.

- For `High shcool equivalent`, the upper and lower bounds of the
  boxplot for the female group are shifted upward compared to the male
  group, indicating that the overall age distribution for women in this
  education level is higher. This suggests that female participants in
  this category tend to be older on average or that women in this
  educational stage may have pursued education at a later age.

- Across all education levels, both men and women show a decline in
  total activity with increasing age. This decline is especially
  pronounced after the age of 60.

- Female participants maintain more stable activity levels over the
  lifespan, with less dramatic declines than men

- Participants with higher education show more stable activity levels
  over time, suggesting that education may correlate with better health
  awareness and sustained physical activity.

- Across all three education levels, the daily activity follows a clear
  diurnal pattern. Activity starts to increase early in the day, peaks
  around midday or early afternoon, and declines toward the evening and
  night hours.

- Female participants exhibit slightly higher levels of activity
  throughout the day compared to males, particularly during the peak
  hours of activity.

- In the `More than high school` group, compared to the other two
  groups, the difference between males and females becomes more
  pronounced. Males show a larger gap in activity levels compared to
  females from midday to evening.
